In some cases, a combination of smaller green pockets and larger central parks may be the best solution.\n\nHere are some additional factors to consider when deciding whether to create smaller green pockets or larger central parks:\n\n* The size of the city\n* The density of the population\n* The availability of land\n* The budget\n* The needs of the community\n\nIt is important to consult with local stakeholders, such as residents, businesses, and community organizations, to get their input on the best approach to creating urban green spaces."
